# Create a Token

I have created a token named Amit Rawat with Solidity. The program can keep track of the total supply of coins, mint and burn tokens.

## Description

Here Token named Amit Rawat is created using solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This program is capable of minting and burning coins. It can give us the total supply of coins.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

First To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Then Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste final_project.sol into the file.
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile final_project.sol" button.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, then click the "Deploy" button.
Now at the left bottom side of the page, there is a section called Deployed Contracts. below that, as you can see contract is deployed and by clicking into MyToken there are functions like bur, mint which will burn and mint coin respectively after that balances button will give a balance of the address that you put into the text field on the right side of the button. further, 3 more buttons will provide the token name, its abbreviation and total supply.

Thank you.
